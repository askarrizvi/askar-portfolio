# askar-portfolio

Challenge 2 -
Description:
This project is a webpage that acts as a portfolio for my web development 
work(and other similar projects).

It contains a bio of me, links to some of my other projects and my contact 
information.

Outside of basic HTML and CSS, there were other more advanced CSS techniques
 that were used, such as hover transitions and media queries. Most of the 
elements within the webpage are styled with flexbox, so they resize and 
rearrange properly based on the viewport size.

Screenshot: See GIT repository for a screenshot of the webpage.
